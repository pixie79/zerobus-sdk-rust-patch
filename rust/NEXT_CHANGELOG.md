# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v2.4.0

### Major Changes

### New Features and Improvements

- Added `MessageRegistry::from_descriptors` (behind the `zeroparser` feature) for building a registry from a parse root plus sibling/imported top-level messages, each keyed by its package-qualified FQN. This lets the zeroparser decode messages whose root fields reference imported well-known types (e.g. `google.protobuf.Timestamp`, `Duration`, and the wrapper types) that `from_descriptor` alone does not register. `others` takes borrowed `&[(&str, &DescriptorProto)]` pairs.

### Bug Fixes

### Documentation

- Reworked ingestion docs to lead with the high-throughput pattern (ingest in a loop, then `flush()` once) and explicitly warn against calling `wait_for_offset()` after every record. Updated the README, crate- and method-level doc comments (`ingest_record_offset`, `ingest_records_offset`, `wait_for_offset`, `flush`), and the `json`/`proto` single-record examples accordingly.

### Internal Changes

- Established `rust/sdk/zerobus_service.proto` as the single canonical gRPC schema, now referenced directly by the cgo Go SDK tests and the Java SDK build instead of their own duplicated (and drifted) copies. No schema or behavior change for the Rust core — the file stays where it was.
